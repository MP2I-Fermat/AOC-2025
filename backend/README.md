# AOC Backend

This is the backend responsible for evaluating and testing user submitted code.

## Developing

The backend is written in [Dart](https://dart.dev) using
[shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf).

Install Dart and run `dart run --observe bin/server_dev.dart` to run the
development server, or use your IDE's Dart extension. `backend` and
`frontend + backend` launch configurations are provided for VSCode.

The development server and the production server both support the following
options:
- `--port n` - bind to port `n` (defaults to 80).
- `--addr a` - bind to address `a` (defaults to `0.0.0.0`).

## Building

Run `dart compile exe bin/server_prod.dart`. The generated executable expects
one additional flag, `--frontend-root`, the location of the frontend files
generated by `jaspr build`.

Alternatively, the root `Dockerfile` can be used to produce an all-in-one image.
